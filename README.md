### Background

This project was part of the Front End Web Development nanodegree course from udacity.


### Description

This game is based off the classic arcade game Frogger where the player must navigate from the bottom of the gameboard to the top without running into enemy bugs.


### Game Features

* control the character using your keyboard
* enemy bugs have varying speeds and starting points
* player has 3 hearts that decrement with enemy encounters
* modal box shows game stats when the game is over
* use the restart icon or replay button to start over


### How To Play

1. The goal is to have your player avoid enemy bugs and cross the street to reach the water at the top of the game board.
2. Use the arrow keys or WASD keys on your keyboard to move your character around the game board.
3. If the player collides with any enemy bugs, you will be reset back to starting position and lose 1 heart.
4. Once you reach the water, a popup will notify you that you have won the game and show game stats.
5. You can use the "Play again" button on the pop-up to start a new game or restart the game at any time using the restart icon.
