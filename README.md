### Background

This project was part of the Front End Web Development nanodegree course from udacity.


### Description

This game is based off the classic arcade game Frogger where the player must navigate from the bottom of the gameboard to the top without running into enemies.


### Game Features

* control the character using your keyboard
* enemies have varying speeds and starting points
* player has 3 hearts that decrement with enemy encounters
* collect gems to earn points
* modal box shows game stats when the game is over
* use the restart icon or replay button to start over


### How To Play

1. The goal is to get your bug safely across the street to the water while avoiding enemy boys.
2. Use the arrow keys or WASD keys on your keyboard to move your bug around the game board.
3. Try to collect gems along the way to gain points!
4. If your bug collides with any boys, you will reset back to starting position and lose 1 heart.
5. The game ends once you either lose all hearts or reach the water and a popup will show your stats.
6. You can restart the game at any time using the restart icon.
